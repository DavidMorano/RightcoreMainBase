Hi Eve,

Check out the attached photographs.  They are of kids playing 
Hide-And-Seek.

Of course, liberals (and other Marxist pigs) want to murder
these kids while they are still in their mother's wombs, but
that is a related story.

My own nieces never seemed to go through this whole "kid" stage
in their lives.  They were just miserable kids their whole lives
from birth, it seems.  Quite sad really.  But at least these
kids shown in these photographs are as cute as can be! :-)
