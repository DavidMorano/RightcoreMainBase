.TH BATCHSIGNAL 1 "1997-02-27" NCMP
.SH NAME
batchsignal \- continue or stop jobs running in specified batch queues
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B batchsignal
.B \-{CONT|STOP}
[
.B \-i
]
[
.B \-q queue_name
]
[
.B jobname ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Batchsignal
continues or suspends running jobs started by
.IR batch (1).
Use 'batchsignal -STOP' to suspend a running job, and 'batchsignal -CONT'
to continue it again.
All batch queues are searched for jobs, unless a
queue name is supplied with
.B \-q.
If no job names (as supplied by
.IR batchqueue(1))
are given, the most recently submitted job from the first queue that
contains an executing job is signalled.
To signal all jobs, give the single
job name "-".
If the
.B \-i
option is given, 
.I batchsignal
asks whether to signal each job found.
.PP
Only the owner of a job, or the super-user, may signal it.
.PP
Queue and job names are interpreted as \fIed\fP(1)-style
regular expressions, so one can avoid typing long job names.
.SH NOTES
This command is not needed on some systems, where the batch jobs
may be signalled directly with
.B kill -STOP
but is required on the Apollo system, where the batch job will be killed
if it is sent a -STOP signal directly.
