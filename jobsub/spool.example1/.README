Available queues:

    now
	A queue that runs jobs now, usually without any reduction in
	priority, one at a time.  This queue is used primarily for
	serializing high-priority requests.

    later
	A queue that runs jobs at a reduced priority, and only when the
	system is moderate to lightly loaded.

    never
	A queue that runs jobs at the lowest priority, and only when
	the system is lightly loaded.  Use this for jobs that you know
	will take a lot of cpu.

    image
	For long-running jobs such as ray-tracing.

    news
	Incoming news articles from the net are queued here for
	decompression and local distribution.

    sys_now
	Like the now queue, but no mail is sent on successful job
	completion.  Used by system processes that don't want to be
	bothered by mail if everything works out.

    sys_later
	Like the later queue, but no mail is sent on successful job
	completion.

    sys_never
	Like the never queue, but no mail is sent on successful job
	completion.
