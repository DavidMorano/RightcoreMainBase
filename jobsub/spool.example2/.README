Available queues:

    short
	A queue that runs jobs now, usually without any reduction in
	priority, one at a time.  This queue is used primarily for
	serializing relatively quick high-priority requests.

    medium
	A queue that runs jobs requiring up to 1 hour cpu time at a
	reduced priority, and only when the system is moderate to
	lightly loaded.

    long
	A queue that runs jobs at the lowest priority, and only when
	the system is lightly loaded.  Use this for jobs that you know
	will take a lot of cpu.

    longnight
	Same as "long", but jobs won't be started outside the
	hours of 11pm to 8am.

    stack
	A queue that runs jobs one at a time at the lowest priority,
	and only when the system is lightly loaded.  Use this for jobs
	that you know will take a lot of cpu and will interfere with
	each other if run at the same time (e.g. Gaussian 88,
	Monstergauss).
