PROGCHECK

We perform some source-code program checking.  We check for unbalanced:
	parentheses, braces, backets, comments, quotes, and literals.

Synopsis:
$ progcheck <file(s)> [-c] [-o <opt(s)>] [-V]

Arguments:
<file(s)>	C-language file(s) to check for correctness
-c		in addition a regular report, report on counts (of stuff)
-o <opt(s)>	options: counts[={0|1}] (default is OFF)
-V		print program version to standard-error and then exit
