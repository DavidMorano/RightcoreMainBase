KEYAUTH

This program will fetch and decrypt the user's private ONC key and give it to
the KEYSERV daemon program.

Care has been taken in this program to NOT use any possible NIS services (like
accessing the system PASSWD information) before a key is given to KEYSERV.
This is done to try to avoid additional authentication denial messages from
appearing on the system console (or whatever the administrator has configured)
showing that an unauthorized access was attempted!  In my view, Sun screwed up
and should have come up with a way to allow access to the PASSWD information
(like with the shadow PASSWD arrangement) WITHOUT also allowing access from
unauthenticated agents!

Anyway, this all means that either the username to authenticate with should be
passed to the program either on its command invocation or in the environment
variable 'LOGNAME'.  If no username can be determined with either one of these,
then the program will just exit without attempting to decrypt any ONC key.
