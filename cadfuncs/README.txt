CAD software additions to SCHEMA


Some of the less used additional features and capabilities for SCHEMA
used in Starbase are here.  Usually, each C language source file makes
up one loadable module to the rest of the CAD software.  Look at the
configurations files for your CAD software (local and system) to see
what modules are loaded for any specific invocation.

Sometimes it is not easy to find out if a module is loaded because
there are so many different ways to get a module loaded inadvertantly
or by virtue of using some module that needs the functions of another.

Remember that source language files are automatically compiled (when
they are located in the software load search path for a particular load
request) if they are out-of-date (that is -- newer) than their
corresponding object files.
