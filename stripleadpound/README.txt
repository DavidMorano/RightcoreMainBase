STRIPLEADPOUND


This program strips all white space before leading pound (octothorpe)
characters.  This is needed for stupid programmers who put leading
whitespace characters before the pound character that introduces
CPP directives in C language programs.

Those stupid programmers do not know that their practice is a violation
of the C language standards !
