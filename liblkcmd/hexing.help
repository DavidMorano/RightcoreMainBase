%{SS}

This program reads one or more files and "unhexifies" them.  It is expected
that the input file contains a series of lines, each of which has some number
of hexadecimal digits (in pairs) representing encoded bytes of the clear text
data.

Synopsis:
$ %{S} <file(s)> [-V]

Arguments:
<file(s)>	file(s) to de-hexify
-V		print program version to standard-error and then exit
