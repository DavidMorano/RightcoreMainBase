CALENDAR

This is a modified vesion of the regular UNIX® calendar program. This program
will use the file "calendar" if the regular file ".calendar" is not present.

Caution: never put any specification for "minutes" in the datemask file for
CALENDAR ('${HOME}/.calendar_datemsk') since that will cause CALPROG to get
confused.
