AUTHRHOSTS

This drectory contains the code to create a PAM module named:

	pam_rhosts_auth.so.1

This version is an enhanced version of the Sun-supplied version in that
it more carefully parses the RHOSTS files so that comments introduced
by the pound ('#') character are not misinterpreted as a hostname!
