== Sample project highlights

Described here are projects that I have worked on as part of software
business exploration (Rightcore Network Services). These projects mostly
are related to information technolofy related utilities, or web server
related functions.


= Network de-multiplexing server family

This project consists of a family of server programs that feature a
de-multiplexing front-end and which dispatches a resulting named service
using a service-dispatch database. These servers act as super-servers
for sub-servers selected based on an acquired service name. These
servers can be configured to listen on a variety of network sources such
as:

+ UNIX domain sockets
+ UNIX named pipes (accepting connections)
+ UNIX named pipes (being passed connections)
+ TCP stream sockets

Services names are acquired based on server types.  Current server types 
de-multiplex incoming connections in the following ways:
+ TCPMUX service name
+ login-name
+ login-name along with a TELNET daemon service
+ finger-name

Access control is also implemented based on the incoming connection IP 
address. Both a custom access database can be used along with any NIS NETGROUP
data which may be present.  Incomming connections which fail authentication
are denied.

Dispatched sub-servers can be of serveral varieties:
+ an independent program (typical)
+ a dynamically loaded shared object command, otherwise looking like an
  indepdent program
+ an already running program which accepts a passed file descriptor


= File backup utilities

This project consists of file backup utilities which perform five main
functions.  These are in turn characterized into two groups.  The first group
of functions form a conventional set of traditional backup 
functions:

+ incremental backups 

= UNIX account management


= UNIX utilities
